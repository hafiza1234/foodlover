							<div class="fast-food-para">Pizza is one of the most popular foods in our city. It's a feel-good food that is easy to grab-and-go for a price that's just right. When you're hungry, you can usually find a pizzeria to grab a slice for a few bucks. You can also stash frozen pizza in your freezer and pop it in the oven for about 10 minutesâ€”and dinner is done in a flash. If you love pizza and balance a slice weekly with vegetables like a salad, it can certainly be a part of a healthy diet. However, if you start eating three or four slices (or more!) on a regular basis that is where your diet can have health consequences.</div>
